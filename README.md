# Web Browser 

This is a basic web browser class from O'Reilly's Learning iOS Programming that can be used over & over again.

* Notes: I'm not sure if I have the network activity / loading implemented correctly. 
* Couldn't see the activity indicator spinning
* Double check performance again at home, mainly on the p189 methods webViewDidStartLoad: and webViewDidFinishLoad:
